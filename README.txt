Dropdown menu user
==================
Dropdown menu user is a module written by developers at La Drupalera by Emergya (www.ladrupalera.com).
This module creates a new dropdown user menu and user login block.
This means this shows up username, password, submit button block in a single line.

Important
==========
1) This also means you need to replace your old user login block with the new
   "Dropdown menu user" block.

2) You might need to "Clear cache" from admin/settings/performance, if the new
   "Dropdown menu user" block does not show up in admin/settings/block.
