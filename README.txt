Readme file for the DROPDOWN MENU USER module for Drupal
---------------------------------------------

Dropdown menu user is a module written by developers at Drupalera by Emergya (www.ladrupalera.com). This module creates a new drop down user menu and user login block. This means this shows up username, password, submit button block in a single line.


Important:
==========
1) This also means you need to replace your old user login block with the new "Dropdown menu user" block.

2) You might need to "Clear Cache" from admin/settings/performance, if the new "Dropdown menu user" block does not show up in admin/settings/block.
